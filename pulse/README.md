# PhonePe Pulse - Data #

The Indian digital payments story has truly captured the worldâ€™s imagination. From the largest towns to the remotest villages, there is a payments revolution being driven by the penetration of mobile phones, mobile internet and state-of-art payments infrastructure built as Public Goods championed by the central bank and the government. PhonePe started in 2016 and has been a strong beneficiary of the API driven digitisation of payments in India. When we started , we were constantly looking for definitive data sources on digital payments in India without much success. As a way of giving back to the data and developer community, we decided to open the anonymised aggregate data sets that demystify the what, why and how of digital payments in India. Licensed under the [CDLA-Permissive-2.0 open data license](https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse/blob/master/LICENSE), the PhonePe Pulse Dataset API is a first of its kind open data initiative in the payments space.
## Announcements ##

## Goal ##
Our goal is to share this data with everyone (license below), so that you can build your own understanding, insights and visualization on how digital payments have evolved over the years in India.
## Guide ##
This [data](https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse/tree/master/data) has been structured to provide details of following two sections with data cuts on **Transactions** and **Users** of PhonePe Pulse - Explore tab.
1. **Aggregated** - Aggregated values of various payment categories as shown under <u>Categories</u> section
1. **Map** - Total values at the State and District levels.
1. **Top** - Totals of top States / Districts /Pin Codes

All the data provided in these folders is of JSON format. For more details on the structure/syntax you can refer to the [JSON Structure / Syntax](https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse#json-structure--syntax) section of the documentation.

### Folder Structure ###

Head to the [data](https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse/tree/master/data) folder to the find below shown structure. Overall, above mentioned sections data can be found at top level folder structure.

Under each of these sections there are folders for **Transactions** and **Users** respectively.

Data for **Transactions** and **Users** is grouped under country level within **India** folder which further grouped the data into each year(_for country level data_) and there is one folder with name **state** which groups data for all the available states of India respectively. 

Similar to country level data, state level data too grouped into each year. All of these year folders(_both at country and state level_) have a maximum of four files with names starting from 1 to 4. These numbers represent each quarter in the selected year. 

<ins>Example</ins>: ```2021 > 1.json``` represents data for quarter 1 (_Jan, Feb and Mar 2021_)

For details on syntax of each of these files, refer to [JSON Structure / Syntax](https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse#json-structure--syntax).
