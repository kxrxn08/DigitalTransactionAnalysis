Source: PwC analysis of RBI dataPrepaid payment instruments (PPIs) have been prevalent in the market since 2002. However, use cases of PPIs have 
remained limited to gift cards, meal reimbursements, foreign exchange cards and reloadable cards for general usage 
such as paying merchants. PPIs witnessed a surge in usage after app-based mobile wallets became operational. Mobile 
wallets made payment more convenient and demonetisation led to users accepting PPIs easily. A few years since their 
introduction, mobile wallets are now being used for bill payments and money transfer, further enhancing the usage of PPIs.
Forex cards are gradually becoming a preferred PPI among outbound travellers.

on-year (YoY) growth rate of approximately 86% until 2018 in terms of both transactional volumes and value. However, the 
COVID-19 crisis is expected to impact the gift cards market and cause a slowdown.
